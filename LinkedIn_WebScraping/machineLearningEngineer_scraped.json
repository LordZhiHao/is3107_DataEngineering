Thales established its presence in Singapore in 1973 to support the expansion of aerospace-related activities in the Asia-Pacific region. Throughout the last four decades, the company grew from strength to strength and is today involved in the primary businesses of Aerospace (including Air Traffic Management), Defence & Security, Ground Transportation and Digital Identity & Security. Thales today employs over 2,100 people in Singapore across all its business areas. The Aviation Innovation Research (AIR) Lab The joint CAAS-Thales innovation lab known as \u2018AIR Lab\u2019 started to operate on 1st November 2019 with the objective to develop Proof of Concepts (POCs) or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) of advanced and open technologies for future Air Traffic Management (ATM). Currently, the joint lab employs a team of 40 Thales engineers and 12 CAAS engineers and air traffic controllers operating in a vibrant ecosystem involving a number of Singaporean SMEs and start-ups, as well as key research institutes. Thales engineers include 10 domain experts \u2013 with more than 10 years of experience \u2013 coming from Thales ATM centers of competence in France and Australia.
