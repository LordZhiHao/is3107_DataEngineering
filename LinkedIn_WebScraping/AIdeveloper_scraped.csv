We're on the lookout for those who are well-versed in the intricate details of operations, from small things like OS installations and break-fix to high-impact projects like planning and operations (covering the full infrastructure lifecycle) to the new design-build facilities or renovations to existing systems. • Monitoring: Your knowledge should transcend the ordinary; we prefer intermediate-level skills. We expect you to be a maestro in the orchestration of tools and designs for monitoring server health, network switches, and the power and temperature conditions of the data center. • Automation: We welcome those who have delved into the realm of automation, ideally at an intermediate level.
