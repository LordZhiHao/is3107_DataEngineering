Sign in Report this job Project Overview We are seeking one or more Postdoctoral Associates, Research Engineers, or Research Scientists in social sciences or related fields to join a project on “Designing human-AI teams.” The project is part of a five-year research program on ""Mens, Manus and Machina—How AI Empowers People, Institutions and Cities in Singapore (M3S)."" Successful applicants for this position will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge, interdisciplinary projects that aim to dramatically rethink how people and AI systems will work together in the future . To do this, the project seeks to build a strong scientific foundation for how AI can augment (as opposed to replace) humans. One important goal of the project is to develop a rich taxonomy of activities that can be performed by human-AI teams. Like mapping the plants and animals on an unexplored continent, the work will involve cataloging many (a) activities and (b) possible human-computer processes for performing these activities. To do this, we will develop knowledge bases that include (1) descriptions of many different types of activities and processes, and (2) classifications of these descriptions into taxonomies that range from very general types of activities to very specific ones. Then, using these knowledge bases, we will develop AI tools to automatically generate promising ways of combining humans and AI systems to perform different tasks. In the long run, we believe these tools will help rapidly (a) identify use cases for new AI capabilities, (b) specify effective processes and task allocations to humans and computers in a given situation, and (c) identify innovative ways to combine people and AI to solve business and societal problems. The T6 team is led by distinguished scholars, including Profs. Thomas Malone, Daniela Rus, and Abdullah Almaatouq from MIT; and Profs. Marcelo Ang and Bryan Low from the National University of Singapore; and will be assisted by Prof. Archan Misra from Singapore Management University. Job Description Successful candidates for this job will participate in one or more activities like the following: Developing descriptions of current or potential activities and processes based on techniques such as: interviews, surveys, field studies, ethnographic observations, and literature reviews. Making editorial decisions about what content to include in the knowledge base, how to present it clearly, and how to organize it in ways that are logical, comprehensive, widely understandable, intuitively appealing, and conceptually elegant. Using human-subject experiments and other social science methodologies (such as cluster analysis) to help improve the above activities as well as to inform and evaluate the development of software tools based on the knowledge bases being developed. Collaborate with the project team and other researchers to design, implement, and evaluate research projects. Perform other duties as needed. Job Requirements Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Social Science (such as Psychology, Sociology, Political Science, and Economics), Management, Organizational Behavior, Philosophy, Journalism, Computer Science (e.g., with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction) Excellent communication and collaboration skills This role is primarily based in Singapore.

Join us in shaping the future of payments and commerce. Let's pave the way for a world where businesses can fully realise their payment potential. There isn’t a single grand definition for what a Solution Engineer (or SE) is. Depending on where you’ve worked, talked to, or even read you might find a number of definitions for it. At Primer, SEs are a merchant’ trusted advisor and technical partner. From their first meeting with Primer, all the way until go-live, SEs are there to work with our merchants. This means everything from running demos, workshops, debugging issues, and everything that it takes to make merchant’ payments experience the best. What you'll be doing? Working closely with our growing sales team to identify merchant pain points; and consulting with those merchants on the value of Primer to address those pain points Providing technical expertise to the sales team to partner with them in business development Translating business requirements into technical solutions, and translating complex technical concepts into simple language Driving forward client engagements via discovery sessions, solution design workshops, product demos, developer Q&As, and more Collaborating with our Product team, using your market learning to identify feature enhancements, as well as new features entirely, that we can bring to market to best serve our merchants What are we looking for? Previous experience in a merchant facing role with a complex API product, ideally in payments Confidence and ease in leading discovery sessions, joining presentations at C-level, and working with technical counterparts at some of the largest merchants Deep interest or knowledge about tech. Being able to understand, explain, and design complex technical specifications is key. Creativity and improvisational skills. Rarely are two merchants alike, and you don’t always have days to prepare for them. Great communication & presentations skills - you can make the complicated sound simple and interact with stakeholders, technical and non-technical, alike A collaborative approach - to efficiently work with clients, partners, and internally, with Product, Engineering, and Sales Drive and motivation; we’re growing fast and we want you to grow with us! Someone who gets things done and makes an impact Experience working in a fast-paced and scaling environment What’s the culture like at Primer? We’re building a culture where people can come and do their best work and enjoy it. We want our people to be proud of the impact that they have at Primer, and of the work that they are doing. You will be working with a team of people who are mission-driven, smart, and reflective, and who are invested in building exceptional products and delivering success for our merchants (and we also know how to have fun along the way). We work remotely. We believe that building a successful, profitable company goes beyond proximity. We invest in our relationships with each other through great remote working practices and thoughtfully designed face-to-face time together. Our heads-together time comes in the form of workstations, our annual company retreat, and co-working space access worldwide. Finally, let’s go ahead and say it. The work that we do is challenging. Startups are a challenge, building category defining products is a challenge. You should be prepared for a challenge at Primer. But, there’s a big difference between a challenge and a struggle. The key difference is that the right challenge comes with the right support structures, an acceptance that not everything always goes to plan, a collaborative environment, and a great team around you. It’s never a challenge that you will face alone. Our benefits: We are fully remote Competitive share options Uncapped holiday, with 25 days minimum to be taken Co-working space access Workations & company retreat The best equipment for your role £500 towards your home office setup Generous learning budget Medical insurance A broad set of additional perks and benefits (depending on location) Don’t meet every single requirement?
