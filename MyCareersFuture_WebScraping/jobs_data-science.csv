Openness and enjoyment of iteratively developing your ideas, drawing on the value of the diverse experience and perspectives of those around you. You recognise the value of having an array of approaches at your disposal rather than focusing solely on one methodology or model.

Familiarity working for FMCG, luxury, beauty, tech, media or gaming brands (agency/ client side)
Knowledge of quantitative, statistical and qualitative research techniques and analysis

We are a diverse team, we value creativity, ‘plussing’ mindset and collaboration. To help create this we offer flexible working and a supportive environment. This includes the following benefits:
