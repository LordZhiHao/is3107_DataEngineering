Our core systems are diverse and come with an unusual intersection of high data volumes with systems distributed across cloud and on-premise infrastructure. On our team you will build solutions that integrate open source software with Appleʼs internal ecosystem. You will drive development of new components and features from concept to release: design, build, test, and ship at a regular cadence. You will work closely with internal customers to understand their requirements and workflows, and propose new features and ecosystem changes to streamline their experience of using the solutions on our platform. This is a true software engineering role, where a large part of an engineer's time is spent in writing code and designing/developing applications on cloud, with the remainder being spent on tuning and debugging codebase, supporting production applications and supporting our application end-users.
